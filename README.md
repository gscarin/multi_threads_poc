# Requests tests


This repo has the purpose to show the differences between **single** thread (synchronous) request and **multi** thread requests.

I used simple request / response webserivce --> https://httpbin.org/uui

But you can change the address to a api url in order to which kind of request will fit better for you


## My results
##### Example of 100 requests
- Single Thread: 19.22 seconds
- Multi Thread: 3.10 seconds
- ✨Magic ✨
